## Project Description:
Implement a distortion effect plugin.

## Input:
The input is the waveform produced by an instrument (e.g. guitar).
The output is the modified waveform after applying the distortion effect.
Use as reference the attached material and choose the parameters that should be
controlled by the user using the GUI.

## Tools:
For simulating the input from an instrument when testing:
- use a sampler or audio file player VST (e.g. on macOS AUAudioFilePlayer) and
feed a wav file as input to your plugin.
- use a free VST (e.g. Guitar or Bass VST) controlled by a MIDI input.

## Output:
- a brief presentation of your work (max 5 minutes) that will be given to the class
- a more detailed report in which you illustrate your audio plugin and its
implementation (max 8 pages).
- a link to a repository containing the code (e.g. on GitHub) with minimal comments.
